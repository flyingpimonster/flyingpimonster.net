# Games
I don't have the attention span to make complicated games, but I still
enjoy it. All my games are made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org),
a super awesome open-source game engine.

## Still Another Asteroid Shooter
My first Android game. Don't expect too much of it, it's just a simple, ad-free
asteroid shooting game. [Available on Google Play.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.flyingpimonster.stillanotherasteroidshooter)

## Squares
Tap the colored tiles in order. That's literally the whole game. [Available on Google Play.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.flyingpimonster.squares)
